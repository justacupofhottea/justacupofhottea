Hi there, I'm Anna

Machine Learning Scientist | GEN and Agentic AI | NLP Enthusiast | Recommender Systems Explorer

🚀 Turning data into decisions, and research into real-world impact.

I’m an ML Scientist with a passion for building intelligent systems — from LLM-powered retrieval models to fairness-aware recommender systems.
My journey began with data analytics and evolved into designing machine learning pipelines that bridge research and production.

🧠 What I work on:

Large Language Models & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs)

NLP applications for semantic search, intent detection & text mining

Recommender systems (collaborative filtering, metric learning, fairness)

Predictive modeling and optimization for data-driven decision-making


💡 Currently @ ARCHIMED (Lyon) — developing internal LLMs and NLP tools to enhance investment insights.
Previously: Inasoft (Fair Job Recommender), Siemens (data pipelines & REST APIs), and Cognaize (AI model audits).
